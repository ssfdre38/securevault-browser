# SecureVault Browser - Build Status & Approach

## Current Status

The GitHub Actions builds are **transitioning** from source builds to a binary-based approach.

## Why Not Build From Source?

Building Chromium from source requires:
- **8-12 hours** of build time
- **100GB+** of disk space
- **32GB+** of RAM
- Specialized build infrastructure

GitHub Actions provides:
- **6 hours max** per job
- **14GB** of disk space
- **7GB** of RAM

**This makes building Chromium from source impossible in GitHub Actions.**

## New Approach: Binary Rebranding

Instead, we:
1. Download pre-built Chromium binaries
2. Apply our branding (icons, name, about box)
3. Apply privacy patches (preferences, default settings)
4. Package as SecureVault Browser

This is how most Chromium-based browsers are distributed (Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, etc.)

## Current Build Status

All three workflows (Linux, Windows, macOS) have been updated to:
- âœ… Download pre-built Chromium
- ðŸš§ Apply branding (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Apply privacy patches (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Package final builds (in progress)

## Development Builds

For local development and testing, you can:

1. **Use Chromium directly** with custom preferences
2. **Install browser extensions** for privacy features
3. **Modify Chromium settings** through policies

## Production Builds

For actual deployable builds, we need to:

1. Set up a dedicated build server (not GitHub Actions)
2. Build Chromium from source with our patches
3. Or partner with existing Chromium distributions

## Alternative: Use Ungoogled-Chromium

The best approach might be to base SecureVault Browser on **Ungoogled-Chromium**:
- Already removes Google dependencies
- Has privacy patches applied
- Provides pre-built binaries
- We can rebrand and add our features on top

Repository: https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium

## Next Steps

1. **Update workflows** to use Ungoogled-Chromium binaries
2. **Create branding scripts** to replace logos/names
3. **Add SecureVault-specific** privacy enhancements
4. **Package for distribution** (AppImage, MSI, DMG)

## For Users

If you want to try SecureVault Browser's privacy features today:

1. Download **Ungoogled-Chromium**: https://ungoogled-software.github.io/
2. Or use **Brave Browser**: https://brave.com/
3. Or use **Chromium** with our recommended settings (see docs/)
